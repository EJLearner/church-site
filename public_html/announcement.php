			<h3>Annual Church Meeting, March 9th, 2010</h3>
		<p>We are planning our annual church meeting for March 9th, 2010 at 7:00 pm.  This is an important meeting given all of the activities that will be involved with the celebration of the church's 40th year of ministry.</p>
		<p>I am asking that you make the effort to pass as much of this information as you can to other church members so that they might be made aware of what is talking place in the life of our church.</p>
		<h3>Congregational Study Literature Available</h3>
		<p>The book which we will be using for our congregational study beginning the first Sunday in Lent have arrived. They will be available for purchase and pick-up during the week whenever we are able to open the office between the hours of 9:00 am and 3:00 pm as well as on Sunday morning following the morning worship.</p>
		<p>Thank you so much for your help in getting this word out.</p>
