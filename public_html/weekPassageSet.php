He is so poor that Mary hasnâ€™t a blanket to warp him in.  In the end he dies naked on the cross so that he might reclothe us and cover our nakedness.  Our sin had left us naked; we had lost the garment of grace.  So Jesus gave up his own life and with it clothed us.  I tell you, then, the soul who has discovered love in the love of Christ crucified will be ashamed to pursue it in any other way than that of Christ crucified.  She will not want pleasure, status, or pomp but will prefer to be like a pilgrim or traveler in this life, with her attention focused wholly on reaching her journeyâ€™s goal.  And if she is a good pilgrim, neither any prosperity she will encounter along the way not any difficulty will slow her down.  No, she will go forward bravely in love and in eagerness forth goal she hopes to reachâ€",

Vulnerability as a healing gift offered to others â€“ this is not unusually the first thing that comes to mind in our culture.  Recently a workshop leader invited participants to voice their associations with the word vulnerability.  Responses included adjectives such as meek, intimidated, naÃ¯ve, inferior, ugly, and foolish.  Vulnerability is not seen as a gift to be given but a weakness to be overcome.  Not vulnerability but security is the ideal that most often governs our national, communal, and personal decisions.  Perhaps one of the greatest sources of loneliness in contemporary life is that our vulnerability, which unites us in a common humanity and enables us to be woven together in love, now is cause for our isolation in fear-filled cells of spiritual solitary confinement.â€",

They could be provoked by memory of sin as well as consideration of the goodness of God, the desire for heaven, he fear of hell, or the thought of judgement.
	Overwhelmingly, tears were understood as a gracious God-given gift, a wonderful physical sign that the inner world of a person was being transformed.

This is a very challenging question.  Maybe we trust God with our thoughts and feelings but what about the material stuff that keeps us fed and housed?
