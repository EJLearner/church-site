	$righttext="<p>The dfree Lifestyle has no fast and easy checklist that fits all situations as it is evangelistic as well as practical. One way to begin is to compile a written list of everything you buy, everything you spend money on, everything you intend to spend money on -- every magazine, every lunch, every breath mint -- in one week. Then, write down WHY you spend money on those items -- groceries, medications, prepared food (such as fast food), car wash, birthday/holiday/sympathy cards.</p>

	<p>This beginning shows where your money goes and should prompt you to identify what you need to change. At the same time, this can apply to your spiritual life -- awareness of your thinking and how it translates into attitudes that command behavior -- benefitting every area of your life. Becoming aware of how your spirit impacts your spending helps to create a system of rules, responsibilities and expectation within your home.</p>

	<p>The holidays are usually family centered and oriented. This means family needs to be informed that you intend to live a debt free life, starting now. Your Aunt Peaches will definitely understand because she has completed a dfree Lifestyle Campaign Training Session. With that base, I've listed a few options below. Please feel free to ask any questions.</p>

	<h3>MAKE A PLEDGE -- should include, but is not limited to</h3>
<ul class='dfreespacedlist'>
	<li>Apply God's strategy for managing your money</li>
	<li>Keep your expenses below your income</li>
	<li>Pay bills on time</li>
	<li>Contribute to your church and its ministries (time, money and talent)</li>
</ul>

	<h3>MAKE A LIST OF EXPENSES and INCOME</h3>
<ul class='dfreespacedlist'>
	<li>Create a chart with at least three columns</li>
	<li>Column One -- Income</li>
	<li>Column Two -- Expenses, including gifts</li>
	<li>Column Three -- Eliminate one-third of the expenses
</ul>
	<h3>INFORM YOUR FAMILY</h3>
<ul class='dfreespacedlist'>
	<li>Gatherings -- determine what your contribution will be, i.e. if you generally contribute five items, reduce the number of items by two, or three and let your family know</li>
	<li>Holiday Gifting -- pick one gift per person; change gifting to picking names and limiting cost; consider gift cards</li>
	<li>Holiday Spending -- determine a budget and stick to it; if emotion or family pressure kicks in -- resist it</li>
	<li>Combine celebrations -- consider small potluck gathering at your home (or another family member's home) that includes several branches of family and/or friends</li>
	<li>Stick to your budget!! This will be the hardest part for some folks to understand.</li>
</ul>
	<h3>CHECKLIST</h3>
	<ul class='dfreespacedlist'>
	<li>List family and friends</li>
	<li>List family events</li>
	<li>List friend(s) events</li>
	<li>List job events</li>
	<li>Request gift/food recommendations, include price range</li>
	<ul class='dfreespacedlist'>
	<li>Gifts -- 3 recommendations costing $10 or less; choose one</li>
	<li>Food -- 2 recommendations costing $15-$20; choose one and commit to that one item</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Begin shopping by September 1 (or, in this case, October 18)</li>
	<li>pick up something each paycheck; for food pick up items that can be frozen</li>
	<li>shop online (Amazon -- put items in Cart, Save for later, Order when on sale); shop Home Goods (appliances, bathroom items, wall pictures); shop Dollar Store (cards, basket of cleaning items, basket of office items/school supplies, gift bags)</li>
	<li>Check off items as purchased</li>
	<li>Store items in a big box in your extra room (or other appropriate area)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please keep in mind that dfree Living is a lifestyle change. It does not happen overnight or immediately; it happens over time -- and, you have to stick with  it consistently. Support from family is important, but not critical.</p>";

	$title="Holiday Debt-Free Tips";
	$holidayclass="class='dfreehighlight'";
	$righttext="<p>Are you ready for all the expenses that come with the holidays? Let's make it a little less stressful by looking at eight ways to save in the next eight weeks.</p>

<h3>1. Trim Your Budget</h3>

<p>The quickest way to having more cash is to go through your budget and cut down on anything that's unnecessary. Can you give up eating out for a month or two? What about going without getting your hair done? In the spirit of giving to others, try to temporarily cut down spending on yourself.</p>

<p>By simply asking your service providers for less expensive options, you may secure a discount or a reduced rate. I just did this with my phone bill. I had an unlimited data plan, and I switched to 3 gigs of data and cut my bill by 40 percent. The worst that can happen is that the company representative says no -- but the best is you could save money on monthly bills just by asking.</p>

<h3>2. Make Your Gifts</h3>

<p>Have a Pinterest-surfing session and get on the hunt for handmade gift ideas. Do you have any artistic abilities, like painting, drawing or knitting? Put those skills to use.</p>

<p>If handmade gifts aren't your thing, consider making your own greeting cards. Plus, your card recipients will feel extra special after receiving such a thoughtful item in the mail or at a holiday gathering.</p>

<h3>3. Change Your Tax Withholding</h3>

<p>If you normally receive a tax refund, try adjusting your tax withholding at your job so that your next few paychecks are a little bigger. That will mean more money in your pocket around the holidays, but a smaller refund. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Getting money back via a tax refund means the government got an interest-free loan from you. Turn that around and enjoy that interest-free loan for
yourself.</p>

<h3>4. Strategically Plan Your Shopping</h3>

<p>Plan when it comes to both everyday shopping and <a href='https://www.dailyfinance.com/2014/10/29/holiday-shopping-strategies-black-friday-beyond/'>shopping for holiday gifts</a>. Consolidate your shopping to a day or two during the week and shop at a cluster of stores if possible. That reduces both mileage, which saves gas, and time (which may save your sanity).</p>

<h3>5. Redeem Reward Points from Credit Cards</h3>

<p>Do you have any unused points waiting to be redeemed from your <a href='https://genyplanning.com/2014/07/30/understanding-your-credit-score/'>credit cards</a>? You can redeem most points for cash back or gift cards than can be used for loved ones. Next year, don't use any of your credit card rewards until the holidays so you'll already have money saved for your holiday shopping. This is a strategy I've used for years.</p>

<h3>6. Look for Coupons and Discounts</h3>

<p>Search for coupons and deals on websites like RetailMeNot. Browse for discounted gifts on deal sites like Groupon or ScoutMob. Make sure you're armed with a list of gifts you want to buy first. This savings strategy can backfire if you buy things just because they're on sale, so use discipline to avoid overspending. Also, ask for price matches at stores.</p>

<h3>7. Shop Online</h3>

<p>We all know about Black Friday, but you can often get some of the best online deals shopping the Monday after Thanksgiving. I got a great deal on my laptop bag by buying it on Cyber Monday.</p>

<p>Besides saving you gas, online prices can be cheaper -- and some online retailers don't charge sales tax. Shopping on a site like Amazon can save you time and help you avoid the holiday rush around department stores and malls. And even traditionally brick-and-mortar businesses, like Target and Walmart, offer exclusive online deals that you can't get in the store. For instance, Walmart is testing matching online prices.</p>

<h3>8. No-Spend Challenge</h3>

<p>If you're really serious about saving in these last weeks before the holidays, establish a no-spend challenge for part of the time, say weekends, every other week or all of November.</p>

<p>A no-spend challenge is what it sounds like: a period that you choose to not spend any (extra) money. Yes, you'll still need spend on rent, utilities, gas and groceries. The no-spend idea is for discretionary expenses, like dining out, going to an event or shopping for yourself. For an added challenge, see how many $0 days you can achieve in a row. One writer I know <a href='https://www.huffingtonpost.com/learnvest/budgeting_b_1916056.html'>used this technique to help pay off her debt</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a no-spend weekend, for example, cook and eat all your meals at home, plan on a family game night or take yourself on a walking tour of some part of your community. Plan on <a href='https://www.dailyfinance.com/2014/06/10/staycations-summer-fun-closer-home/'>free activities</a> or use resources you already have. Then, put the surplus your no-spend time created toward holiday expenses.</p>

	$title="Monthly Saving Advice";
	$monthlyclass="class='dfreehighlight'";
	$righttext="<h2>Reduce Spending &ndash; " . date("Y") . "</h2>

<h3>January</h3>
<p><span class='bold'>Ditch your bank.</span> Monthly service fees are rising, and it's getting harder to avoid them. The average minimum balance needed to avoid fees soared $856 in 2012 to a whopping $4,447, according to a <a href='https://www.money-rates.com/research-center/bank-fees/'>survey of 100 banks by MoneyRates.com</a>. Only 25% of big banks <a href='https://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/big-banks-bigger-fees-1'>examined by the U.S. Public Interest Group</a> still offered free checking.</p>

<p>If you can't ditch the fees, ditch the bank. USPIRG found that 60% of smaller banks still offered free checking. Online banks such as ING Direct, FNBO, Ally and others don't have monthly fees or minimum-balance requirements. Most large credit unions still offer free checking without minimum-balance requirements, as well.</p>

<h3>February</h3>
<p><span class='bold'>Try a \"no spending\" month.</span> Need to pay off debt, boost your savings or just take a break from consumerism? Vow to spend money only on essentials for one month. (February makes a good choice, since it's short.) MSN Money readers who tried this experiment several years ago saved $200 to $400 by eating in, finding free entertainment and staying away from retail stores and sites.</p>

<h3>March</h3>
<p><span class='bold'>Take advantage of your flexible spending account.</span> Most large employers offer these accounts, which allow you to put aside pretax money to pay medical or child-care expenses. Unfortunately, most workers fail to take advantage of FSAs because they fear the \"use it or lose it\" requirement -- you lose any cash you fail to spend by the end of the FSA plan year. However, that actually happens to only 4% of participants so quell your fears and put at least a few hundred bucks in your FSA.</p>

<h3>April</h3>
<p><span class='bold'>Get the full match.</span> Tax time can make you painfully aware of the need to shelter more of your income from Uncle Sam, and there are few better ways to do that than by contributing to a workplace retirement plan. If your company offers a match -- and most large-company plans do -- you should be contributing enough to get the entirety of that free money. If you're worried about missing the money from your paycheck, start by increasing your contribution by just 1% or 2%. Ratchet it up in a few months or the next time you get a raise.</p>

<h3>May</h3>
<p><span class='bold'>Get a better credit card.</span> If you're carrying a balance, look for a low-rate balance-transfer offer that can help you get that debt paid off. If you pay in full every month, make sure your rewards program is still rewarding, since many get watered down as time passes. Your rewards should be worth at least 1% of your spending; many of the best cards today offer twice that, plus they tend to offer generous sign-up bonuses. NerdWallet offers regular reviews of the best rewards cards in various categories (travel, cash back, etc.).</p>

<h3>June</h3>
<p><span class='bold'>Audit your energy use.</span> The average U.S. household spends $2,500 a year on utilities, including natural gas, electricity, fuel oil and water, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You might spend a lot more if you live in a location that gets really cold or really hot. A do-it-yourself home energy audit can help you identify some upgrades that could slash your bills by up to 30%, according to the Department of Energy.</p>
<h3>July</h3>
<p><span class='bold'>Shop for office supplies.</span> If you don't have school-age kids, you may not realize how deeply office supplies are discounted during back-to-school sales -- or how early those sales begin. You can get copy paper, pens, tape, markers and other supplies for a fraction of what they would cost the rest of the year.</p>

	<h3>August</h3>
	<p><span class='bold'>Review automatic purchases.</span> Automatic bill payments are a convenient, secure way to ensure you never incur a late fee or damage your credit scores. But no spending should be entirely automatic. You could be wasting a small fortune on a gym membership you're not using, subscriptions you're not reading or games you're not playing. Internet, television and phone bills may have crept upward without your noticing. Take a few minutes to sit down with your bank and credit card statements to make sure you're getting enough value for your money.</p>

	<h3>September</h3>
	<p><span class='bold'>Contribute to an individual retirement account.</span> This tip won't stretch your dollars now, because contributions to a Roth IRA aren't tax deductible. You'll be glad you did it, though, because the money comes out tax-free in retirement. You can contribute up to $5,500 in 2013 ($6,500 if you're 50 or over). Your ability to contribute begins to phase out at $178,000 in income for married couples or $112,000 for singles. If you make too much to contribute to a Roth directly, however, you can use the \"back door\" by contributing to a traditional IRA then convert it to a Roth, since income limits on conversions have been erased. You may owe taxes on the conversion, and those could be substantial if you have a lot of other money in regular IRAs, so check with a tax professional first.</p>

	<h3>October</h3>
	<p><span class='bold'>Cut your TV/Internet/phone bills.</span> Communications providers are like bad lovers. They make all kinds of promises, and then stick you with big bills. These companies are also jealous of the competition, and you can use that to your advantage. Look for ads or offers from competitors and ask your current providers to match them. Chances are good you'll be offered some kind of discount to stay; play hard to get and the offer may get even better. Or you can just switch and enjoy cheaper service for a while. Just make sure to note on your calendar when the \"teaser\" offers end, so you can start another round of negotiations.</p>

	<h3>November</h3>
	<p><span class='bold'>Create your holiday budget.</span> Gifts, decorations, entertaining, fancy clothes and holiday travel can add up fast. Get a handle on the season early by sketching out a budget that includes each of these categories. Break down your gift list by recipient, and decide how much you'll spend on each. Keep this list with you to remind you of your plan.</p>

	<h3>December</h3>
	<p><span class='bold'>Reuse, repurpose, recycle (and re-gift?).</span> December is focused on getting presents -- yet many of us are already drowning in stuff. Millions of people rent storage lockers to store their excess. Maybe it's time to take a breather. Rather than buying new, ask yourself if you can borrow it, find it used, repurpose something you already have or simply do without.</p>

<p>Dfree&reg; is \"living debt free;\" a lifestyle that promotes discovering more about yourself than you 	do about money. Dr. Soaries set out to help people address and conquer the greatest barrier to 	stress-free living and wealth creation: personal debt. He further considers the dfree&reg; Lifestyle an 	evangelistic tool; a lifestyle adjustment. Training for that lifestyle involves 12 Weeks (or, 12 Steps) of 	guided instruction. Dfree&reg; further stands for freedom to make deposits, earn dividends and possess 	deeds that represent ownership.</p>

The dfree&reg; Lifestyle Campaign is based on the following biblical values:
<ul>
<li>ROMANS 13:8 - &ldquo;Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to 	love one another,...&rdquo; NIV </li>
<li>PROVERBS 22:7 - &ldquo;The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to 	the lender.&rdquo; NIV</li>
<li>LUKE 14:28 - &ldquo;Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit 	down and estimate the cost.&rdquo; NIV </li>
</ul>
The three principles of dfree&reg; are -
<ol>
<li>No debt</li>
<li>No delinquencies</li>
<li>No deficits</li>
</ol >
<p>To date, this program has already launched in numerous African American churches across the 	U.S. with the goal to help 125,000 people pay off $1 billion in debt. We launched the dfree&reg; 	Lifestyle Campaign here at City Temple in March 2014, under the sponsorship of The City Temple 	Development Corporation (CTDC), with 14 registered participants. Since the launch, two training 	sessions have completed with 12 graduates.</p>

Training sessions scheduled for 2015 are:
<ul>
<li>Saturdays -- March 7, 2015-May 23, 2015; 9:30am-11:00am</li>

<li>Tuesdays -- June 3, 2015-July 27 2015; 6:30pm-8:30pm</li>

<li>Saturdays -- September 5, 2015-November 21, 2015; 9:30am-11:00am</li>
</ul>
<p>To register for training sessions, please leave a message on the registration line (410-633-8932), visit 	our web page (<a href='https://www.dfreebaltimore.org'>www.dfreebaltimore.org</a >) or see Deacon Willie Simmons and Bobbie Jean Hargrove.</p>

<p>Our team consists of several roles &ndash; Program Administrators (Willie Simmons, Bobbie Jean 	Hargrove); Trainers (Marlene Jones, LaNette Davis, Chianti Jackson Harpool, Alan James); 	Champion (Adrian Harpool); Ambassador (LaNette Davis). The program is currently recruiting 	trainers and technical assistants.</p>";
