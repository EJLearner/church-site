<p>God has blessed each of us with the time, talent and resources to contribute to His kingdom building.  The Church relies on contributions from its membership to meet the ordinary day-to-day expenses of the church and to meet the needs of others through outreach and missions.
</p>
<p>
On-line giving provides a fast, convenient and secure way for members to offer their tithes.  You can designate your gift for Tithes, General Offering, Benevolence, Building Fund, Missions, Pledge Offering and Outreach the same way you can with your tithing envelope.
</p>
<p>
You will still receive a Yearly Stewardship Report of your tax-deductible offerings in accordance with IRS requirements if you choose to give your offering on-line.  Indicate your tithing envelope box number to ensure your offering will be properly accounted on your Yearly Stewardship Report.
